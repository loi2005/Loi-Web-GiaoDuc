If you're interested in learning with a native English speaker with experience teaching both online and face-to-face, then I'm the teacher for you. Outside of the classroom, I love playing sports and working out as I think they are both so important for your physical and mental wellbeing. My favourite sport to watch is football; the team that I support is Liverpool Football Club. I also love travelling so that I can learn about other cultures and meet people from all over the world. My goal is to travel the world so that I can say that I have been to every country!"
